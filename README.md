# Artificial intelligence
Here are some simple programs, my first step before getting to know more about AI.

## Operating Example
### Perceptron (the simplest form in artificial neural network)
The goal is to learn the truth table for bitwise operators.  
The results show every variable in the perceptron for each epoch.

### Train Model
The goal is to train the model of BMI equation on 100 epochs.  
The results show the train accuracy and test accuracy.
